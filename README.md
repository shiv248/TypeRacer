# Scribing

Scribing is a website application similar to 10fastfingers and typeracer, where the user can test their typing speed and compare their typing speed against their friends.

Shivanshu Gupta and Truman Chan created this web app for their UCM Full Stack Computing course.

It was done with the power of NodeJS in React leveraging statefullness and hooks for the frontend, served on an Express + Socket.io backend, connected to a ClearDB mySQL network relational database and hosted with ❤️ on Heroku.
